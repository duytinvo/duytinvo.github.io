	<!--<h1>Bio</h1>-->
	<p>Tin D. Vo is currently a data scientist at <a href="https://chata.ai" target="_blank">Chata.ai</a>. Before going
		to Laval University to work as a postdoctoral researcher, he obtained the PhD degree in Computer Science under
		the supervision of Professor <a href="https://frcchang.github.io" target="_blank">Yue Zhang</a> at Singapore
		University of Technology and Design (SUTD) in September 2017. He had two-year experience as a lecturer
		at Can Tho University after getting his Bachelor degree there in 2011. His research interests include natural
		language processing (NLP), machine learning and artificial intelligence. He has been focusing on applying
		machine learning and deep learning into sentiment analysis, E-community toxicity and text classification.
		He is recognized in the field by having several publications on the top
		conferences in NLP (i.e. ACL, EMNLP, CICLing) and AI (i.e. AAAI, IJCAI). After graduating, he has been
		centering on employing what he was studied into production by constructing the most efficient and accurate
		text classifiers which are currently used in industry such as language detection and aspect-based sentiment
		analysis. In addition, he is focusing on developing cutting-edge neural network models in NLP such as
		text classification, sentiment analysis, sequence tagging, and topic modelling.</p>
