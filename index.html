	<p>Tin D. Vo is currently a data scientist at Chata.ai. He obtained the PhD degree in Computer Science at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) in September 2017 before going to Laval University to work as a postdoctoral researcher. His research interests include natural language processing (NLP), machine learning and artificial intelligence. He has been focusing on applying machine learning and deep learning into sentiment analysis, E-community toxicity and text classification. He is recognized in the field by having several publications on the top conferences in NLP (i.e. ACL, EMNLP, CICLing) and AI (i.e. AAAI, IJCAI). After graduating, he has been centering on employing what he was studied into production by constructing the most efficient and accurate text classifiers which are currently used in industry such as language detection and aspect-based sentiment analysis.</p>
